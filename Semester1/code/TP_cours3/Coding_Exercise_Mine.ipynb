      " '     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\\n'\n",

      " '     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\\n'\n",

      " '     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\\n'\n",
      " '     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\\n'\n",
      " '     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\\n'\n",
      " '     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\\n'\n",
      " '     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\\n'\n",
      " '     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\\n'\n",
      " '     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\\n'\n",
      " '     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\\n'\n",
      " '     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\n'\n",
      " '     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\\n'\n",
      " '     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\\n'\n",
      " '     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\\n'\n",
      " '     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\\n'\n",
      " '     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\\n'\n",
      " '     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\\n'\n",
      " '     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\\n'\n",
      " '     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\\n'\n",
      " '     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\n'\n",
      " '     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\\n'\n",
      " '     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\\n'\n",
      " '     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\n'\n",
      " '     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\n'\n",
      " '     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\\n'\n",
      " '     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\\n'\n",
      " '     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\\n'\n",
      " '     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\\n'\n",
      " '     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\\n'\n",
      " '     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\\n'\n",
      " '     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\\n'\n",
      " '     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\\n'\n",
      " '     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\\n'\n",
      " '     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\\n'\n",
      " '     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\\n'\n",
      " '     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\n'\n",
      " '     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\\n'\n",
      " '     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\\n'\n",
      " '     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\n'\n",
      " '     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\n'\n",
      " '     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\\n'\n",
      " '     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\\n'\n",
      " '     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\n'\n",
      " '     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\\n'\n",
      " '     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\\n'\n",
      " '     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\\n'\n",
      " '     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\\n'\n",
      " '     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\\n'\n",
      " '     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\\n'\n",
      " '     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\\n'\n",
      " '     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\\n'\n",
      " '     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\\n'\n",
      " '     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\\n'\n",
      " '     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\\n'\n",
      " '     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\\n'\n",
      " '     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\\n'\n",
      " '     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\\n'\n",

      " '     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\n'\n",
      " '     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\n'\n",

      " '     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\\n'\n",

      " '     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\\n'\n",
